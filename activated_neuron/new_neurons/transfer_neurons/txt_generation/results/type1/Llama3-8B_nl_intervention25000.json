Een van de belangrijkste oorzaken van overbevolking is de groei van de bevolking in de steden. De steden trekken mensen aan vanuit de plattelanden en andere steden, wat leidt tot een toename van de bevolking. Daarnaast is er ook een toename van de bevolking door immigratie van buitenlandse landen. Deze immigratie kan worden veroorzaakt door oorlogen, economische problemen of andere factoren.\nEen van de belangrijkste effecten van overbevolking is de druk op de leefomgeving. De steden worden steeds drukker en er is minder ruimte voor de mensen. Dit leidt tot een toename van de luchtvervuiling, het verkeer en de verkeersdrukte. Daarnaast is er ook een toename van de criminaliteit en de misdaad in de steden. De overbevolking leidt ook tot een toename van de armoede en de werkloosheid.

Advances in transportation and telecommunications infrastructure, including the rise of the telegraph and its modern offspring the Internet, are major factors in globalization, generating further interdependence of economic and cultural activities. Though many scholars place the origins of globalization in modern times, others see its origins in antiquity as a process enabled by the Ancient Romans and later empires. Globalization is primarily an economic process of interaction and integration that is associated with social and cultural aspects. However, disputes about what globalization actually is and how it can be measured arise from the fact that it is a concept with a wide and varied meaning. It is often used to refer to economic globalization: the integration of national economies into the international economy through trade, foreign direct investment, capital flows, migration, and the spread of technology. The term is sometimes used in reference to phenomena such as the growth of global consciousness, the growth of internationalization (a specific sociological phenomenon), and the growth of international government organizations (IGOs) to facilitate international trade and other international economic activity. Globalization has grown since the 19th century and has accelerated in the past 20 years.
