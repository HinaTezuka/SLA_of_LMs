MistralModel is using MistralSdpaAttention, but `torch.nn.functional.scaled_dot_product_attention` does not support `output_attentions=True`. Falling back to the manual attention implementation, but specifying the manual implementation will be required from Transformers version v5.0.0 onwards. This warning can be removed using the argument `attn_implementation="eager"` when loading the model.
